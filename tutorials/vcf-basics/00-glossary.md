|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Read             | A short DNA sequence obtained from sequencing a genome.                            |
| Reference Genome | A complete DNA sequence used as a baseline to compare samples.                     |
| Allele           | A version of a gene or DNA sequence at a specific location.                        |
| Genotype         | The combination of alleles present at a particular position in the genome.        |
| Variant          | Any difference between a sample genome and the reference genome.                  |
| SNP              | Single nucleotide polymorphism, a single-base change.                             |
| Indel            | Insertion or deletion of bases in the genome.                                      |
| Contig           | A contiguous sequence of DNA built from overlapping reads.                        |
| Alignment        | Mapping reads to the reference genome to determine their origin.                   |
| BAM              | Binary format for storing aligned sequence data.                                   |
| VCF              | Variant Call Format, a file storing detected variants.                             |
| Annotation       | Additional information about a variant (e.g., predicted effect on a protein).     |
