## ✨ Tutorial Mission: Solving Common Pain Points

This section was created to address common challenges learners face when exploring bioinformatics resources:

* **Too Abstract:** Explanations often use overly academic language.  
* **Too Fragmented:** Concepts are scattered across multiple sites and tools.  
* **Too Tool-Focused:** Tutorials focus on commands before explaining the underlying concept.

> **Our Goal:** **Understand the concept first, then master the tool.**
