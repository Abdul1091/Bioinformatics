Welcome to my Bioinformatics Portfolio, a comprehensive and continuously developing collection of my work, studies, research notes, scripts, and projects in genomics, computational biology, machine learning, and data science.

This repository serves as:

📚 A structured learning hub for all my courses (Stanford, Coursera, edX, Kaggle, NCBI, etc.)

🧬 A research notebook for genomics, variant analysis, and computational bio approaches

🧪 A workspace for step-by-step reproducible bioinformatics pipelines

📂 A central portfolio to support applications for MSc/PhD Bioinformatics programs

🚀 A long-term professional archive of my growth as a computational biologist
